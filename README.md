# Other People Projects

<b><i>This list presents the projects of other people, written in lisp, or relevant lisp programming language</i></b>

<b>[ub-lisp](https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/ub-lisp)</b><br>
Краткий курс по Коммон Лиспу.


<b>[roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell)</b><br>
Roswell is a Lisp implementation installer/manager, launcher, and much more!
Roswell started out as a command-line tool with the aim to make installing and managing Common Lisp implementations really simple and easy.
Roswell has now evolved into a full-stack environment for Common Lisp development, and has many features that makes it easy to test, share, and distribute your Lisp applications. With Roswell, we aim to push the Common Lisp community to a whole new level of productivity.


<b>[shelly](https://github.com/fukamachi/shelly)</b><br>
Shelly enables you to execute Common Lisp functions like a shell command. And it also can be used as a Make-like build-tool.
Shelly has the following features:
* Provides shell command-like interface for Common Lisp functions;
* Dumps a Lisp core for fast execution;
* Allows to define project specific commands (shlyfile);
* Implementation independent.
    
    
<b>[avesh](https://gitlab.com/ralt/avesh)</b><br>
A Very Extensible Shell.
The goal of avesh is to be super extensible. The point is to be able to hack around the shell as much as we want.
Bash and zsh, although powerful, have fairly limited hackability. One thing I wanted to do was being able to prevent a command from running, and run something else instead. I couldn't. With avesh, I can.


<b>[PIC](https://github.com/takagi/pic)</b><br>
PIC Is a Compiler for 8-bit PIC micro controllers
A native compiler for 8-bit PIC micro controllers written in Common Lisp. The host language is a pretty small subset of ML-like language and the target language is 8-bit PIC micro controller assembly. Common Lisp is the compiler language.
